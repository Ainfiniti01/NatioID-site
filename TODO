🔹 SOLUTION SUMMARY (Add trust)

Add 2 bullets:

🛡️ Identity + authentication workflow simulation
🧾 Audit trail & transparency framework

And one disclaimer:

Note: This is a non-government prototype. No real citizen data collected.

🔹 DEMO SECTION (Very important rewrite)

Current wording suggests it's “frontend only”.
Instead, rewrite like this:

This prototype demonstrates core flows and UI/UX for a national digital identity + e-voting system.
Future versions will integrate:
✅ Backend identity services
✅ Cryptographic voting protocols
✅ Secure API infrastructure

Add:

📂 View Source Code
Since Repo is private, say: Code available on request for gov/civic partners.

🔹 FEATURES (Add Gov-tech structure)

Add:

🛂 Identity Lifecycle Simulation
🔐 2-step identity verification flow
📤 Document upload UI (prototype)
📑 Voter roll & polling registry UI

Add “Roadmap” section:

📍 Future Enhancements Roadmap

Blockchain-backed voting ledger (optional wording: tamper-evident ledger)

Facial biometrics (research stage)
